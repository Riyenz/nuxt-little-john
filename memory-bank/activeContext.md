# Active Context

## Current Focus

### Analytics Dashboard Enhancement

- Successfully implemented comprehensive analytics dashboard with Chart.js
- Added three main visualizations:
  1. Tasks Completed Per Day (Bar Chart)
  2. Task Status Distribution (Pie Chart)
  3. Weekly Productivity (Line Chart) with multiple status datasets
- Integrated with tasks store for reactive data updates
- Implemented proper loading and error states
- Ensured responsive layout across all device sizes

### Recent Changes

- Added dayjs integration for improved date handling
- Implemented multiple datasets in weekly productivity chart
- Fixed chart sizing and responsiveness issues
- Enhanced error handling and loading states

### Active Decisions

- Using Chart.js for data visualization
- Implementing reactive data binding with Pinia store
- Using dayjs for consistent date handling
- Following mobile-first responsive design

### Current Considerations

- Potential for additional analytics insights
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Accessibility improvements for charts
- Future integration with task categories and priorities

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement task categories/tags system
2. Add priority levels for tasks
3. Integrate due dates functionality
4. Enhance analytics with category and priority insights

## Open Questions

- How to optimize chart performance with larger datasets?
- What additional analytics insights would be most valuable?
- How to best integrate future features (categories, priorities) into analytics?

## User Experience Improvements

- API endpoint restructuring to follow RESTful patterns
- Task management simplification with self-assigned tasks
- User experience improvements with sensible defaults
- Security and authentication improvements
- User-specific data filtering
- Token refresh handling
- State management for user changes
- Dark mode implementation
- Profile management features
- Settings page functionality

## Recent Changes

- Restructured API endpoints into `/api/tasks` folder
- Implemented RESTful URL patterns for task operations
- Removed assignedTo field to simplify task ownership
- Set today as default due date in task form
- Updated tasks store to use new endpoint structure
- Implemented secure API endpoints that return only authenticated user-specific data
- Added token refresh handling in useApi composable
- Implemented user state management in tasks store
- Added auto-refresh of tasks on user change
- Added task clearing on user logout
- Added user settings page with display name editing
- Implemented dark mode toggle
- Updated UToggle to USwitch component for dark mode
- Simplified profile settings interface
- Enhanced form validation with Zod
- Added toast notifications for user feedback

## Next Steps

- Implement dark mode support
- Add analytics features
- Create user settings page
- Add advanced task features (inline editing, drag-and-drop)
- Implement user settings and preferences
- Add task analytics and reporting
- Enhance error handling and user feedback
- Add task search and advanced filtering
- Implement task categories and tags
- Add advanced task filtering options

## Active Decisions

- Tasks are now self-assigned through createdBy field
- API endpoints follow RESTful patterns
- Default due date is set to today for better UX
- Using Firebase authentication for user management
- Filtering tasks by createdBy email for user-specific data
- Using token refresh for better security
- Implementing optimistic updates for better UX
- Auto-refreshing data on user changes
- Using Firebase Storage for profile pictures
- Using Nuxt's built-in color mode for dark mode
- Using Zod for form validation
- Using toast notifications for user feedback
- Profile picture editing disabled for security reasons

## Current Considerations

- Security best practices for API endpoints
- User experience improvements
- Performance optimization
- Error handling standardization
- Performance optimization for large task lists
- Offline support possibilities
- Real-time updates for collaborative features
- Enhanced security measures for sensitive data
- Performance optimization for image uploads
- Error handling for file uploads
- Security measures for file storage
- User feedback mechanisms

## Code Quality

- RESTful API design
- Type safety
- Error handling
- Security best practices
- Code organization
- TypeScript for type safety
- Zod for form validation
- Vue 3 Composition API for better code organization
- Pinia for state management
