# Active Context

## Current Focus

- API endpoint restructuring to follow RESTful patterns
- Task management simplification with self-assigned tasks
- User experience improvements with sensible defaults
- Security and authentication improvements
- User-specific data filtering
- Token refresh handling
- State management for user changes

## Recent Changes

- Restructured API endpoints into `/api/tasks` folder
- Implemented RESTful URL patterns for task operations
- Removed assignedTo field to simplify task ownership
- Set today as default due date in task form
- Updated tasks store to use new endpoint structure
- Implemented secure API endpoints that return only authenticated user-specific data
- Added token refresh handling in useApi composable
- Implemented user state management in tasks store
- Added auto-refresh of tasks on user change
- Added task clearing on user logout

## Next Steps

- Implement dark mode support
- Add analytics features
- Create user settings page
- Add advanced task features (inline editing, drag-and-drop)
- Implement user settings and preferences
- Add task analytics and reporting
- Enhance error handling and user feedback
- Add task search and advanced filtering
- Implement task categories and tags

## Active Decisions

- Tasks are now self-assigned through createdBy field
