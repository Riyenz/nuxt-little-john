# Active Context

## Current Focus

Task Management System Enhancement Phase

## Recent Changes

- Implemented full CRUD operations for tasks with API integration
- Added edit and delete functionality with confirmation modals
- Enhanced TaskFormModal with edit mode support
- Improved type safety across components
- Added optimistic updates for better UX
- Implemented error handling and state management

## Next Steps

1. Error Handling & Notifications

   - Implement toast notifications for CRUD operations
   - Add error boundaries
   - Enhance error messages and feedback

2. Testing & Documentation

   - Add unit tests for CRUD operations
   - Document API integration patterns
   - Update component documentation

3. Performance Optimization
   - Implement request caching
   - Add loading skeletons
   - Optimize re-renders

## Active Decisions

1. Error Handling Strategy

   - Decision needed: Global error handling vs component-level
   - Consider: User experience, debugging, maintenance

2. Testing Approach

   - Decision needed: Testing library selection
   - Consider: Component testing, API mocking, coverage goals

3. Caching Implementation
   - Decision needed: SWR vs custom caching
   - Consider: Data freshness, complexity, maintenance

## Current Considerations

1. API Integration

   - Error handling patterns
   - Loading state management
   - Optimistic updates
   - Request cancellation

2. User Experience

   - Loading indicators
   - Error feedback
   - Form validation
   - Confirmation flows

3. Code Quality
   - Type safety
   - Component composition
   - State management patterns
   - Testing strategy
